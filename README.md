Some things to know. First there is a Start.py and a Start_up.py. There is also in the Game folder a GameStructure.py and a game structure1.py file. This is because 2 are not built to a proper code structure and one is. I have never built anything to a proper code structure before so I am building the code in a non proper code sturcture first then when I get it completed and working I will ATTEMPT to build it in a proper code structure but I don't know how it will go. Also the none proper codestructure files could be a little confusing so try not to pay much attention to how the code is structured if you take a look at all the functions you should be able to figure out what does what in what order. I say this because I use a bunch of while not loops inorder to create functions that can be called and canceled and I don't know of any othere way to do it. Also what can be comfusing is the names I used for all the while not loops but the names don't matter too much it is what the loops do that matters. Also you will see all the sound and image files in the main folder. I want to move them into their own package.
